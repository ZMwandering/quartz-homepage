## 👋 About Me

I am a senior undergraduate at **Peking University (Yuanpei College)** majoring in **Artificial Intelligence**, a member of the **Tong Class** program.

My research lies at the intersection of **Multi-Agent Systems**, **Game Theory**, and **Cognitive Science**, driven by the question: *how does intelligence emerge through interaction?* I am particularly interested in building agents that model beliefs and intentions, maintain shared context, and reason strategically in long-horizon, imperfect-information environments.

My work spans **neuro-symbolic architectures for strategic reasoning**, **cognitive-inspired learning paradigms**, and **LLM-based multi-agent communication**. I have developed symbolic-LLM reasoning modules for bridge bidding, implemented recursive Theory-of-Mind planners, and studied biologically inspired learning mechanisms to understand how efficient adaptation arises in both artificial and natural systems.

Across these projects, I aim to integrate **symbolic structure**, **cognitive theory**, and **deep learning** to design socially intelligent agents that coordinate, communicate, and learn through interaction.
