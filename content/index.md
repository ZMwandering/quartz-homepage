## 👋 About Me

I am a senior undergraduate at **Peking University (Yuanpei College)** majoring in **Artificial Intelligence**.  
My research interests focus on **Multi-Agent Systems (MAS)**, **Game Theory**, and **LLM Agents**, especially how to improve **strategic consistency, few-shot adaptation, and reasoning efficiency** in complex multi-agent environments.

I have worked on **LLM-based bridge bidding**, **mixed-motive adaptive agents**, and **computational neuroscience models of learning dynamics**. I particularly enjoy bridging **symbolic reasoning, LLMs, and game-theoretic modeling**.
